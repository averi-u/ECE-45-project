# Sound and Music Synthesizer App  
*UCSD | ECE*

## ðŸ”Š Overview  
This project is a sound and music synthesizer application developed for the ECE 45 course at UCSD. It allows users to generate, modify, and test various sound signals and waveforms using input sound files. The application features a virtual keyboard, waveform generators, filters, and other sound-effect modules, along with end-to-end testing and agile sprint communication.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features  
- Virtual keyboard interface to play and record notes  
- Waveform generators: sine, square, triangle, sawtooth  
- Sound-signal filters: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-reject  
- Envelope generator (attack, decay, sustain, release)  
- Volume control and tremolo effect  
- Sound file import/export for custom processing  
- End-to-end testing of audio pipelines  
- Agile development: sprint planning, progress tracking, GitHub workflow
